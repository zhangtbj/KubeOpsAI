## Background
Kubernetes, while powerful, poses several challenges:
- **High Entry Barrier**: Complex learning curve for new users.
- **Component Complexity**: Numerous interconnected components such as pods, services, deployments, and nodes.
- **Difficult Issue Diagnosis**: Troubleshooting requires significant expertise and time.
- **Monitoring and Observability Limitations**: Setting up efficient monitoring is often complex and requires additional tools.

KubeOpsAI addresses these challenges by introducing AI-driven insights and automation to streamline DevOps tasks within Kubernetes environments.

## Key Features
- **Automated Diagnostics**: Automatically identifies and resolves issues within the Kubernetes environment, reducing manual effort.
- **Intelligent Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes traffic flows to ensure correct routing and to identify anomalies.
- **Event History Insights**: Provides historical event data to quickly identify recurring issues.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Utilizes log data to correlate information and improve debugging efficiency.
- **AI-Powered Commands**: Executes Kubernetes commands and provides summarized insights with AI-driven context.

## Architecture
The architecture of KubeOpsAI is designed to integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes, offering the following core components:
1. **KubeOpsAI UI**: A user-friendly dashboard for querying and visualizing insights.
2. **KubeOpsAI Controller**: Manages requests and orchestrates the processing of commands.
3. **AI Agent Jobs**: Executes commands, queries Kubernetes resources, and generates insights.
4. **External AI APIs**: Supports integrations with open-source and IBM AI APIs for model responses.

### Workflow
1. User inputs a prompt or question in the KubeOpsAI UI.
2. The controller translates the prompt into Kubernetes commands.
3. The AI Agent Job executes these commands, retrieves the relevant data, and processes it with AI.
4. A response is generated and displayed in the KubeOpsAI UI.

## Installation
To install KubeOpsAI in your Kubernetes environment:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KubeOpsAI.git
    cd KubeOpsAI
    ```
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Deploy KubeOpsAI using the provided Kubernetes manifests:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f manifests/
    ```
4. Configure the integration with your preferred AI API in the `config.yaml` file.

## Usage
To begin using KubeOpsAI:
1. Access the KubeOpsAI dashboard.
2. Use predefined prompts or create custom queries to diagnose issues or gain insights.
3. View AI-generated summaries and recommendations.

### Example Commands
- **Check Cluster Status**: "What is the status of my Kubernetes cluster?"
- **Pod Debugging**: "Help me check my HelloKubeOps Pod in the default namespace and provide error insights."
- **Service Accessibility**: "Why can't my HelloWorld service in the test namespace be accessed?"

## Roadmap
- Integration with additional AI models, including fine-tuned Kubernetes-specific models.
- Expanded functionality for multi-cloud environments.
- Enhanced RBAC security controls and advanced logging capabilities.
